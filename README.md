# Project 2 â€“ COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

## Overview
This project uses **SQL** to explore global COVID-19 data, analysing both **infection trends** and **vaccination progress**.  
The dataset includes information on COVID-19 **cases, deaths, and vaccinations**.  
The goal was to clean, query, and extract insights that highlight the Impact of the pandemic across countries and continents.  

---

## Objectives
- Explore infection rates and death rates across different countries.  
- Identify countries and continents with the **highest case counts** and **highest death tolls**.  
- Compare infection rates relative to population sizes.  
- Analyse vaccination rollout trends across the world.  
- Apply SQL techniques like **joins, window functions, CTEs, temp tables, and views**.

## ðŸ› Tools & Skills
- **SQL** (data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis)  
- **Joins** (linking COVID deaths and vaccination datasets)  
- **Window Functions** (rolling sums for cumulative vaccinations)  
- **CTEs** and **Temp Tables** (simplifying complex queries)  
- **Views** (saving reusable queries)

## Analysis Performed
1. **Case Fatality Rate** â†’ % of people who died after being infected.  
2. **Infection Rate** â†’ % of population infected in each country.  
3. **Highest Infection & Death Rates** â†’ Ranking countries by total cases and deaths.  
4. **Continental Analysis** â†’ Which continents had the highest death tolls.  
5. **Global Death Rates** â†’ Aggregated death rate worldwide.  
6. **Vaccination Progress** â†’ Tracking rollout using cumulative sums.  
7. **Top 10 Vaccinated Countries** â†’ By vaccination rate relative to population.

## Key Insights
- Some countries had very high infection rates relative to their population size.  
- Death rates varied significantly across regions, with some continents reporting far higher totals.  
- Vaccination rollout was uneven, with certain countries achieving much higher vaccination rates.
